# Theming

SuperDocs uses a CSS Variable based theming system, powered by Tailwind CSS.

## Color System

We define two main semantic colors in `docs-config.json`:

1.  **Primary**: Used for links, active states, and primary buttons.
2.  **Accent**: Used for highlights and secondary elements.

These values are converted into CSS variables (H, S, L components) at runtime and injected into the page root.

```css
:root {
  --color-primary: 99 102 241; /* #6366f1 converted to RGB/HSL channels */
  --color-accent: 34 211 238;
}
```

This allows us to support opacity modifiers in Tailwind (e.g., `bg-primary/50`).

## Dark Mode

Dark mode is supported out of the box. SuperDocs respects the user's system preference and persists manual overrides in `localStorage`.

## Custom CSS

You can inject custom CSS by adding a `styles` array to your `docs-config.json` (Coming Soon). For now, you can use inline `<style>` tags in your MDX files for page-specific overrides.
