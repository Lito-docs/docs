# Architecture

SuperDocs is essentially a wrapper around [Astro](https://astro.build). It abstracts away the boilerplate of setting up an Astro project, configuring MDX, tailwind, and other integrations, while exposing a clean configuration surface.

## The Build Process

When you run a command like `superdocs build`, the following happens:

1.  **Validation**: The CLI validates your `docs-config.json` against a schema.
2.  **Scaffolding**: A temporary `.superdocs` directory is created. It contains the core Astro templates (layouts, components).
3.  **Content Injection**: Your markdown files are copied into the `.superdocs/src/content/docs` directory.
4.  **Config Injection**: Your `docs-config.json` is parsed and injected into the build context.
5.  **Astro Build**: The CLI runs `astro build` inside the `.superdocs` directory.
6.  **Output**: The resulting static files are copied to your specified output directory (default: `dist`).

## Why Astro?

We chose Astro because:

- **Content Collections**: Astro's content collections API is perfect for managing documentation pages.
- **Islands Architecture**: We can hydrate interactive components (like search or tabs) while keeping the rest of the page static HTML.
- **Performance**: Astro builds zero-JS by default, ensuring your docs are blazing fast.
