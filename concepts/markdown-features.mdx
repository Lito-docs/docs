# Markdown Features

Lito supports standard GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) and MDX.

## Standard Syntax

You can use all standard markdown features:

- **Bold**: `**text**` -> **text**
- *Italic*: `*text*` -> *text*
- [Links](https://example.com)
- Lists (ordered and unordered)
- Blockquotes

## Code Blocks

We use Shiki for syntax highlighting.

```js
console.log('Hello World');
```

## Callouts / Admonitions

We support GitHub style alerts:

> [!NOTE]
> This is a note.

> [!TIP]
> This is a tip.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is important information.

> [!WARNING]
> This is a warning.

> [!CAUTION]
> This is a caution.

## MDX Components

You can import and use components directly in your markdown. By default, Lito exports several built-in components globally (no import needed).

### Cards

<Card title="Example Card" icon="star">
  This is a card component.
</Card>

### Tabs

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="npm">
  ```bash
  npm install @litodocs/cli
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="yarn">
  ```bash
  yarn add @litodocs/cli
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
