# Customizing Theme

SuperDocs allows you to easily customize the appearance of your documentation site to match your brand.

## Basic Colors

The easiest way to change the theme is by modifying the `theme` object in your `docs-config.json`.

```json
{
  "theme": {
    "primaryColor": "#6366f1",
    "accentColor": "#22d3ee"
  }
}
```

- **primaryColor**: The main brand color (links, buttons).
- **accentColor**: Used for highlights and gradients.

## Logo and Favicon

You can update your logo and favicon in the `branding` section:

```json
{
  "branding": {
    "logo": {
      "src": "/logo.svg",
      "href": "/"
    },
    "favicon": "/favicon.svg"
  }
}
```

Ensure your `logo.svg` and `favicon.svg` files are placed in the `public` directory of your docs folder (or if using a simple folder structure, just in the root alongside `docs-config.json`, though `public` folder support is idiomatic Astro).

*Note: For the current version, place static assets in the root folder and reference them relative to root.*
