# Analytics

Lito supports Google Analytics 4 (GA4) out of the box with zero performance impact.

## Google Analytics 4

Lito uses [Partytown](https://partytown.builder.io/) to run Google Analytics in a web worker, ensuring your site remains fast and responsive.

To enable it, add the `integrations.analytics` section to your `docs-config.json`:

```json
{
  "integrations": {
    "analytics": {
      "provider": "google-analytics",
      "measurementId": "G-XXXXXXXXXX"
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `G-XXXXXXXXXX` with your actual Google Analytics Measurement ID.

## Performance

By running analytics scripts off the main thread, Lito ensures:

- **Perfect Lighthouse Scores**: Analytics scripts don't block the main thread.
- **Fast Interactions**: UI remains responsive while analytics load.
- **Privacy**: Scripts are sandboxed in the web worker.
