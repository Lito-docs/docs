# Deployment

Since SuperDocs generates a static site, you can deploy it to any static hosting provider.

## Building for Production

To create a production build, run:

```bash
npx superdocs build -i ./my-docs
```

This will generate a `dist` folder containing your static HTML, CSS, and JS files.

## Vercel

1.  Push your code to a Git repository.
2.  Import the project into Vercel.
3.  Set the **Build Command** to: `npx superdocs build -i ./docs` (adjust `./docs` to your folder).
4.  Set the **Output Directory** to: `dist`.
5.  Deploy!

## Netlify

1.  Push your code to a Git repository.
2.  New site from Git.
3.  **Build command**: `npx superdocs build -i ./docs`.
4.  **Publish directory**: `dist`.
5.  Deploy site.

## GitHub Pages

You can use a GitHub Action to build and deploy.

```yaml
name: Deploy Docs
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
            node-version: 18
      - run: npx superdocs build -i ./docs
      - uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./dist
```
