# Adding Pages

SuperDocs uses a file-system based routing, but the sidebar navigation is explicitly defined in `docs-config.json`. This gives you full control over the order and hierarchy of your docs.

## Step 1: Create the File

Create a new Markdown or MDX file anywhere in your content folder.

```text
my-docs/
  guides/
    new-page.mdx
```

## Step 2: Add Frontmatter

Add metadata to your file:

```markdown
---
title: My New Guide
description: This is a new guide I created.
---

# My New Guide

Content goes here...
```

## Step 3: Update Config

Add the page to your sidebar in `docs-config.json`.

```json
{
  "navigation": {
    "sidebar": [
      {
        "label": "Guides",
        "items": [
          {
            "label": "My New Guide",
            "href": "/guides/new-page"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The `href` should match the file path relative to the root, minus the extension.
