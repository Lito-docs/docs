# Welcome to SuperDocs

SuperDocs is a powerful, flexible, and design-forward documentation generator built on top of Astro. It allows you to create stunning documentation sites with minimal configuration, while giving you the full power of Astro and MDX when you need it.

## Key Features

- **Zero Config**: Get up and running with a single JSON file.
- **MDX Support**: Use React/Preact/Svelte/Vue/Solid components directly in your markdown.
- **Auto-generated Sidebar**: Your file structure dictates your sidebar (unless you override it).
- **Theming**: Fully customizable color palettes and branding.
- **Interactive Components**: Built-in components like code playgrounds, tabs, and more.
- **SEO Optimized**: Standard SEO practices built-in.

## Philosophy

SuperDocs was built with the belief that documentation should be:

1.  **Beautiful by default**: You shouldn't need to be a designer to have good looking docs.
2.  **Fast**: Both for the end user and the developer.
3.  **Extensible**: Easy things should be easy, hard things should be possible.
