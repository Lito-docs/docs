# Quick Start

In this guide, we'll walk through creating your first documentation site with Lito.

## 1. Prepare your Content

Create a new folder named `my-docs` and add an `index.mdx` file:

```markdown
---
title: Welcome
description: My first Lito site
---

# Hello World

This is my documentation site!
```

## 2. Add Configuration

Inside `my-docs`, create a `docs-config.json` file:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "name": "My Docs",
    "description": "My awesome documentation"
  },
  "navigation": {
    "sidebar": [
      {
        "label": "Welcome",
        "href": "/"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## 3. Run the Dev Server

Run the following command in your terminal (make sure you are in the parent directory of `my-docs`):

```bash
npx @litodocs/cli dev -i ./my-docs
```

## 4. View your Site

Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser. You should see your "Hello World" page!

## What's Next?

- Add more pages.
- Group pages into folders.
- Update `docs-config.json` to organize your sidebar.
