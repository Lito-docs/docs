# Installation

Getting started with SuperDocs is straightforward and fast. Whether you want to try it out immediately or integrate it into your project, we've got you covered.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Version 18.0.0 or higher
- **npm**, **yarn**, or **pnpm** package manager

## Installation Methods

### Global Installation

Install SuperDocs globally to use it across multiple projects:

```bash
npm install -g @devrohit06/superdocs
# or
pnpm add -g @devrohit06/superdocs
```

Then use it anywhere:

```bash
superdocs build -i ./my-docs -o ./dist
superdocs dev -i ./my-docs
```

### Method 1: The Quickest Way (npx)

If you just want to spin up a docs site from an existing folder of markdown files without installing anything:

```bash
npx @devrohit06/superdocs dev -i ./my-docs-folder
```

This command will:

1. Scaffold a temporary Astro project
2. Copy your docs into it
3. Start a local development server at `http://localhost:4321`

### Method 2: Adding to an Existing Project

If you want to keep your docs versioned with your code:

1. Create a `docs` folder in your repository
2. Add a `docs-config.json` file inside it
3. Add Markdown or MDX files
4. Run from your root:

```bash
npx @devrohit06/superdocs dev -i ./docs
```

### Method 3: Using a Custom Template

You can use custom templates from GitHub or local paths:

```bash
npx @devrohit06/superdocs dev -i ./docs -t github:owner/template-repo
# or
npx @devrohit06/superdocs dev -i ./docs -t ./path/to/local/template
```
