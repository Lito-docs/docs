# Installation

Getting started with SuperDocs is straightforward. You can run it directly via `npx` or install it as a dependency in your project.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Version 18.0.0 or higher.
- **npm**, **yarn**, or **pnpm**.

## Method 1: The Quickest Way (npx)

If you just want to spin up a docs site from an existing folder of markdown files:

```bash
npx superdocs dev -i ./my-docs-folder
```

This command will:
1.  Scaffold a temporary Astro project.
2.  Copy your docs into it.
3.  Start a local development server at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Method 2: Adding to an existing project

If you want to keep your docs versioned with your code:

1.  Create a `docs` folder in your repo.
2.  Add a `docs-config.json` file inside it.
3.  Add some `.md` or `.mdx` files.
4.  Run from your root:

```bash
npx superdocs dev -i ./docs
```

## Method 3: Scaffold a new Docs Site

To create a brand new SuperDocs project:

```bash
npx superdocs create my-new-docs
cd my-new-docs
npm install
npm run dev
```
