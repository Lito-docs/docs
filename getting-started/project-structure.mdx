# Project Structure

When you run `lito dev` or `lito build`, the CLI processes your input folder and generates a full Astro project. Here's what your input folder should look like:

```text
my-docs/
├── docs-config.json  # Global configuration
├── index.mdx         # Homepage
├── getting-started/  # A folder for a section
│   ├── index.mdx     # Section landing page (optional)
│   └── setup.mdx     # Content page
└── api/
    └── endpoints.mdx
```

## Key Files

### `docs-config.json`

This is the brain of your documentation site. It controls:
- **Navigation**: The sidebar structure.
- **Branding**: Logo, favicon, colors.
- **SEO**: Meta tags, OpenGraph images.
- **Integrations**: Analytics, etc.

### `index.mdx`

Every folder can have an `index.mdx` file.
- The root `index.mdx` is your site's homepage (`/`).
- Sub-folder `index.mdx` files (e.g., `getting-started/index.mdx`) are accessible at that route (`/getting-started`).

### Frontmatter

Every markdown file must have a frontmatter block at the top:

```yaml
---
title: Page Title
description: A short description for SEO and search.
---
```
